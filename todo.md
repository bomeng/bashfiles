# TODO

Generally, with a mind for not stepping on eachother's toes, let's try to causing merge conflicts. This is a working doc, update with more info as it becomes relevant or issues become raised.

* Use specific branches for specific objectives: 

		Boxes - (currently, not permanently) state routing
		Gulp - fixing gulp
		Templates - update templates
		Style - CSS updates
		etc... 

* Avoid drastic folder restructuring outside of commits

		Use ````git rm```` && ````git mv```` instead of Finder


## Krry

* templates

## Lazarus

@Krry, does this make sense?
