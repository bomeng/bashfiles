# Requirements and Priorities

## From meeting with Beamer (19 Nov 2014)
    1. Boost the homepage conversions in a meaningful way in the short term
    2. Focus on selling the $0 down PPA without the need for professional sales intervention
    3. Need a devoted acquisition team with expertise in UX: user research, user testing, interaction design, UI engineering, web design, web funnel analytics, etc.
    4. Aim to ramp up online selling throughout 2015

## From meeting with Pete (20 Nov 2014)
    1. Gather the chief stakeholders (Beamer, Tanguy, Hayes, and Pete) to decide:
        * whether we can book site surveys (subject to ODA confirmation) prior to contact with sales personnel - what safeguards do we need in place?
        * whether we can offer a proposal prior to contact with a sales personnel - what safeguards and fallbacks do we need in place?
    2. Push live video call functionality to later release, in favor of live chat and phone calls about designs through Twilio


### Software priorities
    - focus on broad functionality before deep functionality - a working app means more in the short term
    - observe lots of system designs on the fly - output images of designs
    - make the app easily testable and reconfigurable - modules wherever possible
    - serve top 98% of browser/version share of our current traffic - no IE8!!!
