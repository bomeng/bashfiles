          <strong>Environmental</strong>
          <p>Over 20 years, the average 5 kWh solar power system offsets 50 tons of CO2. That's the equivalent of:
            •  Driving a car 125,000 miles.
            •  CO2 absorbed by 60 trees.
            •  40,000 gallons of water used to make electricity.
