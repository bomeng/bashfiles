  <!-- TODO: remove internal jargon from this copy; prospects won't know a 'soft' from a 'hard' credit check -->
  <p>We’ll run a soft credit check to determine what financing we can offer you. This won't affect your credit score. We'll talk through your options with you once your professional design is complete so we know your exact system size/production.</p>
  <p>If you are not interested in financing and prefer to purchase your system, you'll want to contact a sales representative directly. Give us a call now at <strong><a href="tel:18887652489">(888) 765-2489</a></strong>.</p>

  <ul class="financing-options-list">
    <li><strong>SolarPPA</strong>&nbsp;Pay only for the power your system produces with little to no upfront costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Solar Lease</strong>&nbsp;Make a fixed monthly payment at locked-in low rate.</li>
    <li><strong>MyPower loan</strong>&nbsp;Own your system from day one for $0 down.</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase</strong>&nbsp;If you wish to purchase your system, skip this step. Pay cash upfront and enjoy free, clean energy for years.</li>
