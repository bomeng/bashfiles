      <p><strong>What's a soft credit check?</strong></p>
      <p>A soft credit check is one that does not affect your credit score. A soft credit check is recorded in your credit history, but is only visible to you and not visible to lenders.</p>
      <p>We do this to determine what financing we can offer you. We’ll walk through your financing options with you once your professional design is complete so we know your exact system size/production.</p>
      <p>If you’re not interested in financing and prefer to purchase your system, skip this step and give us a call at <strong><a href="tel:18776707652">(877) 670-7652</a></strong> to speak with a solar consultant.</p>
