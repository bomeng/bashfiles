    <p><strong>How this works:</strong></p>
    <ul class="connect-the-dots">
      <li>Schedule your site survey.</li>
      <li>A site surveyor will come to your house. We'll need someone over 18 present for the entirety of the survey, which should last 1-2 hours.</li>
      <li>The site surveyor will study your roof as well as your current energy consumption. The surveyor will need access to the top of your roof as well as your attic to take measurements.</li>
      <li>A few days after your site survey, you'll receive your final system design from our experts.</li>
      <li>Review your professional design, final proposal and sign your contract.</li>
      <li>Sign up and schedule your install.</li>
      <li>Turn it on.</li>
    </ul>
