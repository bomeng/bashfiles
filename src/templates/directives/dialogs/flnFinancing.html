    <p>The Solar PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) is the most popular plan our customers choose to go solar and save money on electricity costs. With our Solar PPA, you pay for your solar power by the month, just like your current utility bill, only lower. You’ll lock in your solar electricity rates for up to 20 years, protecting you from future energy price spikes. And, with multiple payment options including $0 down, you control how and when you pay for your electricity.</p>

    <p>The money you pay your utility every month gets you one thing: electricity. But what if that money also went toward owning the power plant? With MyPower, your dollars work harder, providing you more than just power for your home. With every payment you’ll be building equity in an asset that can add value to your home, reduce your overall energy costs by up to 40% and offset tens of thousands of pounds of CO2.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Surprises are great, just not when it comes to money.  So when an unexpectedly hot month leads to an unexpectedly high utility bill, your budget could take a hit. The Solar Lease protects you from energy price fluctuations with low, fixed payments that are often less than what you’re paying now for electricity. That means 20 years of savings on your energy costs, plus the peace of mind to know what your payments will be today, tomorrow and 20 years from now.</p>
